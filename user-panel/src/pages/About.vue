        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Sparc’s mission is to create a peer-to-peer social network community that economically empowers you for what you enjoy doing at times you enjoy doing them.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>Our Community</h2>
        <p>Sparc’s community facilitates organic connections and meaningful interactions between uncommon friends–standing in contrast to traditional social media or networking models that prioritize connections among acquaintances, friends or family.</p>
        <br/>
        <h2>What’s in it for me</h2>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 15px;">As a Host</h3>
            <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <li>
                    <p>On the one side, Sparc enables “hosts” to publish or showcase their expertise via an “engagement” and create value from the engagement through the exchange of money, charitable fundraising, or audience sourcing (by connecting with a target audience through a controlled setting based on preferences such as time, location, guest count, etc.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>From the host perspective, our platform removes any potential embarrassment and any unwanted attention accompanying the proffering of skillsets, knowledge, and access (network) in exchange for monetary value.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <h3 style="margin-top: 10px;">As a Guest</h3>
            <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <li>
                    <p>On the other side, Sparc provides “guests” with easy access to “hosts” possessing a specific expertise or connection, and a general awareness of all the “hosts” located in our community.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You can identify specific engagements tailored to your interests or needs on-demand (realtime) or in the near future (by direct messaging a particular “host”) around the world.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>The “host” determines many variables: price point, date, time, time parameters, and location of the engagement.</p>
        <p>The “guest” may choose to accept the terms or conditions from any host.</p>
        <p>Monies are then held in escrow (Sparc a.k.a. Escrow House) at the point of transaction and transferred to the host after successful completion of their engagement.</p>
